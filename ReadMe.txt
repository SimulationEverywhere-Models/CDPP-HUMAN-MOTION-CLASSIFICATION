The Assignment 1 contains two parts: the final report and the program files.

In the final report, each atomic model and the coupled models are described in detail.

The atomic models are:
pc, cameras, preprocessor, classifier.

There are two coupled models:
motion_capture_system, hmc
motion_capture_system is composed of "pc" and "cameras" while hmc is the Human Motion Classification system which is basically the entire system.

In the program files, for each atomic model there exists 6 types of file:
*.h
*.cpp
*MA.ma
*.ev
*MA.log
*MA.out

For each coupled model there are 4 other files in the form of:
*MA.ma
*.ev
*MA.log
*MA.out

The file register.cpp registers all the models to be employed by the main (complete) coupled system.

The file HumanMotionClassification.docx (final report) is also available in the main folder for further study.
